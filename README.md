# Linen Image Models

limo is an easily customizable image model implementation with pre-trained variables. The pre-trained variables are loaded correctly even if you add or remove modules. Currently, this project would like to reimplement `torchvision.models`.

## Prerequests

- jax, jaxlib
- flax
- chex
- einops
- requests
- tqdm

In addition, pytests, torch, and torchvision are required to test this project.
